# Competitor List Generator

Given a .CSV file whose columns are formatted as: <br/>
<b> EVENT NAME GROUP </b> <br/>

This python script will read in each row, extract a list of unique competitor names, and output another .csv file
that shows every event and associated stage and round for each competitor. <br/>

The input file used for the actual event (Western Regional Championships 2018 by CubingUSA) is RegionalGroups.csv. The file output when fed into the Python script is exportFile.csv.
